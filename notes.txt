OVERVIEW:
  The two primary modes of the bottom sheet are Modal and Persistent.
  * Persistent mode:
    * the sheet is always mounted.
    * can be expanded, collapsed, or hidden (collapsed/hidden optional).
    * background can be interacted with at all times.
  * Modal mode:
    * the sheet is only mounted when visible.
    * decide whether dismissing is allowed: via swiping down, tapping overlay, or back button.
    * can be expanded or hidden (hidden only allowed when dismissable). note: collapsed not available
    * background has a dimmed overlay, cannot be interacted with.

PROPS:
  * state  (String, required)
    > Three available states: `hidden | collapsed | expanded`.
  * height  (String|Number, required)
    > The fully-expanded height of the sheet.
  * modal  (Bool, default `false`)
    > Determines the behavior of the bottom sheet, see below.
  * onStateChanged  (Func)
    > Fired when the user changes the sheet state.
  * inline  (Bool, iOS)
    > Constrains the sheet within its parent container. Always true on Android, unless modal mode is used.

MODAL ONLY:
  * dismissable
    > Whether the modal can be dismissed. This includes swiping the sheet down, tapping the overlay, or the back button (Android).
  * tapToDismissModal
    > Whether the background can be tapped to dismiss the modal.

PERSISTENT ONLY:
  * collapsedHeight  (String|Number)
    > Enable the `collapsed` state by setting the height. When undefined, it is analogous to `expanded`.
  * hideable  (Bool, default `true`)
    > Whether the user can drag the sheet down to hide it. (Note: sheet can always be hidden by setting `state` to `hidden`)

iOS STYLING PROPS:
  * All the various FittedSheets options.
